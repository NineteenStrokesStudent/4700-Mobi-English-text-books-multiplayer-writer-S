        <dc:description>&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from college with a business administration degree—and very uncertain about his career path—Aiken embarked on a yearlong journey throughout Canada and the U.S., trying out new jobs for one week at a time and donating all his wages to a charity. It's a bit contrived and by now familiar (A.J. Jacobs has written a shelf of such books), but Aiken is an appealing guinea pig. Readers expecting a meditation on work (or working at all during a recession, let alone finding 52 jobs) should look elsewhere; this is a lark and Aiken tests a variety of unusual jobs (NHL mascot, snowshoe guide, tattooist/piercer, bungee jumping instructor, cattail picker) and more traditional career paths (research assistant, park ranger, and mayor). The takeaway isn't particularly profound (Traveling taught me a lot about myself. I experienced new cultures, met all sorts of people, and was forced outside my comfort zone on a daily basis), but it's a lighthearted read and a pleasant—if unmemorable—vicarious journey to take. &lt;em&gt;(May)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It started as a simple idea: work a different job every week for a year.  But as Sean put his plan into action, it quickly became a life-changing, cross-continental, action-packed adventure.  After reading &lt;strong&gt;The One-Week Job Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; you'll know how to bring the most extraordinary things out of life, and how to score some choice jobs along the way!"—Kyle MacDonald, author of &lt;em&gt;One Red Paperclip&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With 52 jobs, 52 experiences and 52 lessons learned, Sean Aiken has done all the dirty work for young individuals who are looking to embark on their own career journey.  &lt;strong&gt;The One-Week Job Project&lt;/strong&gt; is eye-opening, entertaining and will help answer the question on any young individual’s mind: what do I do when I graduate?  Sean has done it all in less time than it takes to graduate from college and has pulled all of his knowledge into one book that can and will change your life for the better."—Dan Schawbel, author of &lt;em&gt;Me 2.0: Build a Powerful Brand to Achieve Career Success&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;The One-Week Job Project&lt;/strong&gt;_ _is a terrific read for young people wondering what to do with their lives, and for anyone looking to change his or her life for the better. Sean Aiken’s audacious, inspiring book packs a good dose of humor and reminds us that the only thing standing between you and your dreams is yourself!" —Keith Ferrazzi, author of &lt;em&gt;Never Eat Alone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Who’s Got Your Back&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At a time when the traditional path to success is fading from view, Sean Aiken has emerged as a role model for making the best of the inherently unstable life of today's workforce. Most people will likely work a number of different jobs in a variety of different fields over the course of their lifetimes, and most people will feel uneasy during transition. Aiken’s book shows 52 transitions, and they add up to a vital message that job hopping is productive and can help you find a better career, and build a better life."—Penelope Trunk, nationally syndicated career columnist and author of _Brazen Careerist: The New Rules for Success&lt;br /&gt;_&lt;br /&gt;"Who says job hopping is a bad thing? Sean Aiken worked 52 jobs in one very busy year and documented the life-changing experience in his wonderful new book, &lt;strong&gt;The One-Week Job Project&lt;/strong&gt;. Sean takes you on a rollicking journey across the U.S. and Canada to gigs as an astronomer, brewmaster, cowboy, and deejay (among many others).  He shares hilarious stories and valuable advice from mentors in pubs and tattoo parlors, on &lt;strong&gt;dairy farms and movie sets,&lt;/strong&gt; and in kitchens and cubicles. I loved the opportunity to tag along on Sean's year of career enlightenment without having to sleep on 55 couches and trek more than 46,000 miles. I think you will too. &lt;em&gt;The One-Week Job Project&lt;/em&gt; is a great read and a terrific resource for anyone looking for inspiration on the job."—Pamela Skillings, career coach and author of _Escape from Corporate America: A Practical Guide to Creating the Career of Your Dreams&lt;br /&gt;_  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;The One-Week Job Project&lt;/strong&gt; is a remarkably original idea that will inspire a new generation of young people to stay true to themselves, shed the noise around them, and set out to define their own roads in life. This book will help you to take a critical look at your own future, and all the possibilities that lie waiting."—Mike Marriner, co-founder, Roadtrip Nation and author of _Roadtrip Nation: A Guide to Discovering Your Path in Life  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_"The long-held idea of ‘trying on’ jobs before you ‘buy’ them now gets a fresh approach, as the author ‘tries on’ fifty-two jobs within the space of fifty-two weeks."—Richard N. Bolles, author of &lt;em&gt;What Color Is Your Parachute&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't say whether Sean Aiken was a good aquarium host or tattoo artist, but I do think he's very good at one job: Writing."—A. J. Jacobs, author of _The Year of Living Biblically  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_"What is it like to work 52 jobs in as many weeks?  Sean Aiken took it upon himself to find out, and he shares his discoveries with us in &lt;strong&gt;The One Week Job Project&lt;/strong&gt;.  A fantastic concept, and a fascinating book!"—Marshall Goldsmith, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Mojo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;What Got You Here Won’t Get You There&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>
